# FingerPrint spoofing detection

- The main goal of the course was to learn the theory behind the machine learning algorithms that we used, not how to write great ML code in python, that's why the source code may not be particularly appealing.
- The main ML functions developed during the laboratories, and used for the project are in `utils.py`, the other files were used to write scripts in order to make all the needed analysis.
